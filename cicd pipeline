    Developers push code frequently to a shared repo.
    Automated build + test pipeline runs.
    Ensures code is always in a releasable state

CD → Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

    Continuous Delivery:
          Code is automatically tested & packaged.
          Deployment requires manual approval.
    Continuous Deployment:
          Code is automatically deployed to production with NO manual approval.
